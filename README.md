#Arcade Game

##How to Run the Game
Open the `index.html` file in your browser by double clicking on the file. All other assets will load automatically. (If the file opens in a text editor, right click and select 'Open with' to choose your browser of choice. Chrome is recommended.)

To keep track of your wins and losses, keep playing without refreshing your page. Refreshing your page will reset the wins and losses to 0.

##How to Play
Use your arrow keys to navigate the player to the water. Don't get hit by any bugs! They will run you over and you will have to start from the beginning.
